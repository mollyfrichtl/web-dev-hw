I think this was harder than what we have been doing. It was new because we haven't used the combination of things we did but we used old things to make the new combination. It was tricky but manageable.

I am excited to do more styling in general rather than just the content input.

This work cycle I combined what I had been doing. I went step by step but I read the whole thing. Then went back through again and still went step by step without skipping anything and moving around.

Yes, I learned a lot! Something I learned and thought was cool was the fact that you can connect the sites we work with and have it show up as your site separately.
I knew you could apply color but something new I learned this course was about the codes that go with colors.
For this final, I opened all past websites and walkthroughs and went step by step trying not to miss something. I got stuck a few times but I'm hoping it turned out okay.

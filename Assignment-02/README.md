# Assignment 2
## Molly Frichtl

I am taking this class because it counts to towards my "outside the business school credits" while still being useful to my marketing degree.

1. I hope to learn about coding because I've never used coding before.
2. I've already learned something new from using Atom and Github.
3. I would like to learn more about creating websites from scratch.

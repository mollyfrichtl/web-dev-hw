    <p>Social Security last month estimated that in 2035, after nearly all baby boomers retire, there will be 2.2
    workers per beneficiary. Last year, there were 2.8. The current birthrate of around 1.8 children per woman is expected to create a
    Social Security deficit of nearly <b>$2 trillion</b> over the next 75 years.</p>

    <p>Prospects for a quick turnaround aren’t good. Men and women in their 30s are marrying at rates below every other generation on record.
      “We’ll have to rethink a lot of things about taxation and how social programs are funded if fertility is really on a more permanent decline,”
      said <i>Anqi Chen</i>, assistant director of savings research at the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.</p>

    <p>Growth in property values and the stock market this past decade helped older households regain ground since the recession. Millennials, though, have made little headway.
      “If I can’t afford a home, I definitely can’t afford kids,” said Joy Brown, 32 years old. She is a renter who is single and earns $75,000 a year. She also owes $102,000
      in student loans and $10,000 in credit-card debt. “Myself and a lot of my peers still feel like we’re playing catch-up in the game of life,” said Ms. Brown, a compliance
      officer for the city of Chicago.</p>

    <p>Joy Brown makes $75,000 a year working for the city of Chicago and has $102,000 in student debt.</p>

    <p>More than half the 72 million American millennials are now in their 30s. The oldest will turn 38 this year, when their generation is expected to surpass the number of baby boomers.
    Their slow start has been well-documented in the first years after the recession. New data show that millennials may never catch up with the generations of Americans that preceded them.</p>

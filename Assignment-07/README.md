Divs are the separate blocks. Ids are within a div and are unique and different from any other ids. It is a "global identifier" to that specific piece. Classes are also within a div. Classes are also used as identifiers. They are different than ids because there can be more than one of them. Lastly, spans are used to block within a block. They are similar to a div but they are within a div.

Alt Text is also known as Alternative Text. It is used to describe the image, in text, just in case the image itself cannot be seen.

I was very happy with my work cycle. Instead of working step by step but backwards within each element. I went step by step within the elements. I also didn't move on to a different element if I was stuck. I truly went from A to Z.

   <h4>How MOCK'S was created</h4>
    <p>There once were two girls at a University in Montana t
      hat loved Mexican food and pineapple, occasionally loved a good margarita,
      and of course the beach! They had this crazy idea to open a Mexican Bar on
      the beach and were determined to make it the hottest spot on the Santa Monica Pier.
      Come in and join our party and see that our dream has come to life!</p>

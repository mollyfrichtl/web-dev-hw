The internet is the network as a whole, made up of individual networks. The internet makes it possible for devices to connect with each other. The web is the different components and search engines within the internet that help make those connections. 
The internet is legitimately a wire in the ground that servers and computers can connect to. Everything you search on the internet has an IP address with a specific name. These are found when we use computers which are not directly hooked up to the internet themselves. They work through servers, so we call them "clients." The search process starts with a computer, works through DSL so you may find the IP addresses and webpages you are looking for on the internet. When connecting with other computers, the internet sends messages or pictures in packets. Packets break down those messages, with the help of a router, and reforms the original message when it reaches its destination.
A directory is a folder that gives direction to an image. Directories are trees where the route is built into subdirectories. Files are found in the parent directory. 
VCS is important because gives us a way to save and look at our work as a whole during the process and at the final product.

Universal is used for every element on the page while element separates by each element. You would use these when wanting to stay uniform and do it all at once or if you want every single thing to be different.Class selectors are used for multiple elements but with the same function and Id is for style rules. These are used when wanting to save time but be specific.

I used yellow: rgb(181, 137, 0), cyan: rgb(42, 161, 152), and white: base3: rgb (253, 246, 227) because it went with the era I chose.

This assignment was really hard for me. I still don't really understand it all.

    <p>While colors are colors and we don't expect them to change over the years.</p>
    <p>But they do!</p><p>Looking back at the 1950's we can see that they not only used
      funny names,</p><p> but they used colors that were a muted or rusted version of what we
      see today.</p>
    <p>Now while they had a neat color scheme goin'. Now that we are in the 20th
      century we are saying,</p><p> "Well show me a picture!" But they were still in the times of
      black and white photography.</p><p>So this is what we would commonly see when looking back
      by way of photograph.</p><p>You might also notice the different fashion and styles.</p>

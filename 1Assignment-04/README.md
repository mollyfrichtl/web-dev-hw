I went to the year 1997. This is the year I was born. Things are so different now and I wanted to see what an image might've looked like back then. It is fascinating to me because I was alive, but I don't remember photos looking old. I look at pictures now and they are clear with perfect color. This image is faded and brown. I am looking at a picture of the world trade center. Now it isn't standing there and there is more city where it used to be.

The GIT module was not hard to figure out. Also, the module is easier to navigate while connecting programs. This saves us from having to jump around on our screens. It keeps everything more organized.
